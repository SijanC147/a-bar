## Unreleased

_No changes yet._

## v1.7.0 - 2026-09-27

First release of the SijanC147 fork, published as a Homebrew Cask through Hextap.

- feat: storage widget picks which disks to show (every disk, or a selection matched by volume UUID) and what to show (percentage used, percentage remaining, or space remaining)
- feat: Time Machine widget, reading `tmutil status` and `tmutil currentphase`
- feat: CPU & GPU widget drawing both on one graph
- feat: sound and microphone widgets can show a level bar behind the icon
- feat: GPU widget has its own icon
- fix: saving settings follows a symlinked `~/.a-barrc` and replaces the target atomically
- chore: the bundle version comes from `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`

## v1.6.0 - 2026-09-21

- chore: deadcode removal
- fix: a single unrecognised value in the config no longer resets every setting - unknown widgets, themes and malformed values are now repaired one value at a time
- fix: a config file that cannot be read is preserved and quarantined instead of being overwritten with defaults, with the last known good config kept as a backup
- fix: launch at login had no effect - the toggle was wired to a local state while the app unregistered the login item on every settings change
- fix: the menu bar bar-visibility toggle and the AppleScript widget commands now persist, and are no longer reverted by the next save from Preferences
- fix: layouts saved from before the profile system are recovered instead of silently reset
- fix: selecting a profile to edit no longer marks its layout as modified, which could write it to the wrong profile
- refactor: the config file is now the single source of truth with one writer, defaults come only from the property initializers, and profile invariants are enforced on every load
- test: add a unit test target covering settings decoding, repair, migration and persistence
- feat: refactor Wi-Fi functionality into a dedicated service like the Bluetooth widget
- ci: run the test suite on every push and pull request, and fail the build when a test file is not a member of the test target
- test: cover widget layout accessors, graph history, AeroSpace decoding and theme colour handling
- fix: a custom widget script that prints more than 64KB no longer hangs until its timeout and comes back cut off - its output is now read while the script runs
- fix: an unreadable colour value is no longer rendered fully transparent, which made the widget disappear instead of showing a colour that could be corrected
- fix: colour values no longer lose a step per channel each time they are saved, which made a customised theme drift darker over repeated edits
- test: cover yabai state filtering, the formatting and colour helpers, and shell command execution
- fix: a custom widget script whose output uses Windows line endings now shows its dropdown instead of printing the whole script into the bar with stray characters
- test: cover xbar-style script output parsing, and split the parser from its menu building
- fix: a new profile name that differs from an existing one only by surrounding spaces is now recognised as a duplicate instead of being accepted
- fix: update button style to bordered for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi widgets
- refactor: the layout builder's drag payload, reordering and custom-widget index handling moved out of the views into tested logic
- test: cover layout drag and drop, widget reordering, custom-widget index remapping and profile name validation
- fix: a critically low battery now shows red - the warning was unreachable, so a battery at 2% looked the same as one at 45%
- fix: an AeroSpace space that is visible but not focused no longer draws a stray dark rectangle behind its background
- fix: a long single-word keyboard layout name is now shortened instead of pushing the rest of the bar along
- refactor: widget colours, labels, weather presentation and graph geometry moved out of the views into tested logic, removing several branches that could never be reached
- test: cover widget threshold colours, volume handling, bar labels, weather presentation, graph points and bar placement
