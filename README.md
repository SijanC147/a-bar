> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a fork.** [SijanC147/a-bar](https://github.com/SijanC147/a-bar) is Sean Bugeja's fork of [Jean-Tinland/a-bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/a-bar), by Jean Tinland. It adds a storage widget with disk and value choices, a Time Machine widget, a combined CPU & GPU graph, and level bars for sound and microphone, starting at v1.7.1. Releases on this page are built from the fork. For upstream builds, issues and support, use the upstream repository.

Yet **a(nother) bar** :)

A native macOS menu bar replacement inspired by [simple-bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar), built with Swift and SwiftUI. It is a standalone recreation of simple-bar with a focus on performance, stability, and extensibility.

**Notice: As I am working simultaneously on a lot of projects, things here may seem to move slowly but they are still in progress. I'm always monitoring my notifications and messages, so if you have any questions or want to chat about anything, feel free [to reach out](https://www.jeantinland.com/contact/)!**

> [!CAUTION]
> **Note of caution:** Even in v1.x.x, _a-bar_ stays in early development. Expect bugs and missing features. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

> [!NOTE]
> **About signing and notarization:** _a-bar_ is not signed or notarized. **This means that you will need to bypass macOS security to run it, and you may see warnings about the app being from an unidentified developer**. I'm not planning to notarize the app as it would cost almost $100/year.

## Preview

## Backlog

You'll find all the bugs and list of planned features in the [GitHub backlog](https://github.com/users/Jean-Tinland/projects/2/views/1).

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) or [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) (for window management features)
- [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional, for GitHub notifications)

> [!NOTE]
> _a-bar_ can be used without yabai or AeroSpace, but you won't be able to use the spaces & processes widgets. You can still use _a-bar_ as a system status bar replacement with its included widgets and your custom ones.

## Installation

You'll find the full installation guide in the [documentation](https://www.jeantinland.com/toolbox/a-bar/documentation/installation/).

Here's a quick summary:

### Homebrew (upstream builds)

Upstream's tap installs Jean Tinland's builds, not this fork's:

```bash
brew tap Jean-Tinland/a-bar
brew install --cask a-bar
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Note:** [Homebrew installation](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/homebrew-a-bar/blob/main/Casks/a-bar.rb) script automatically removes the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute. That way the app should work out of the box without having to open System Settings to allow it.

### Manual installation (this fork)

1. Download the latest release from this fork's [Releases](https://github.com/SijanC147/a-bar/releases) page: `a-bar-darwin-arm64.zip` for Apple silicon, `a-bar-darwin-amd64.zip` for Intel
2. Move `a-bar.app` to `/Applications`
3. As the app is not notarized you will need to do the following:
   - before launching the app for the first time: run the following command in Terminal: `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/_a-bar_.app` then launch _a-bar_
   - after launching the app for the first time, you will need to: open `System Settings` > `Privacy & Security`, then click `Open Anyway` next to the _a-bar_ warning
4. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

> [!NOTE]
> `xattr` command removes the quarantine attribute that macOS assigns to apps downloaded from the internet.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## AI notice

I wrote this with some help from Claude Opus: it mainly worked on the interfaces with native macOS APIs, layout builder and the profile system. I'm still in the process of learning Swift and SwiftUI, so I expect some code to be unoptimized or not following best practices.

**I'm now mainly using Claude Code for maintaining and improving the project.**

If you have suggestions for improvement, please let me know!
